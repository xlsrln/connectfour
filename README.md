haskell connect four


you need wxHaskell which needs wxWidgets to compile this!

the gui is quite ugly but it does work.

recent fixes: 
- tells you if a player won (and disables the buttons)
- tells you if the game ended without anyone winning
- doesn't allow you to play a full column

want:
- monospaced fonts
- nicer interface
- colours and stuff
